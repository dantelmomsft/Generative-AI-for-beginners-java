# Practical Applications & Projects

## What You'll Learn
In this section we'll demo three practical applications that showcase generative AI development patterns with Java:
- Create a multi-modal Pet Story Generator combining client-side and server-side AI
- Implement local AI model integration with the Foundry Local Spring Boot demo
- Develop a Model Context Protocol (MCP) service with the Calculator example

## Introduction

This chapter showcases **sample projects** that demonstrate generative AI development patterns with Java. Each project is fully functional and demonstrates specific AI technologies, architectural patterns, and best practices that you can adapt for your own applications.

### Foundry Local Spring Boot Demo

The **[Foundry Local Spring Boot Demo](foundrylocal/README.md)** demonstrates how to integrate with local AI models using the **OpenAI Java SDK**. It showcases connecting to the **Phi-3.5-mini** model running on Foundry Local, allowing you to run AI applications without relying on cloud services.

### Pet Story Generator

The **[Pet Story Generator](petstory/README.md)** is an engaging Spring Boot web application that demonstrates **multi-modal AI processing** to generate creative pet stories. It combines client-side and server-side AI capabilities using transformer.js for browser-based AI interactions and the OpenAI SDK for server-side processing.

### MCP Calculator Service (Beginner-Friendly MCP Demo)

The **[MCP Calculator Service](calculator/README.md)** is a simple demonstration of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** using Spring AI. It provides a beginner-friendly introduction to MCP concepts, showing how to create a basic MCP Server that interacts with MCP clients.

## Learning Progression

These projects are designed to build upon concepts from previous chapters:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the Foundry Local Spring Boot Demo to understand basic AI integration with local models
2. **Add Interactivity**: Progress to the Pet Story Generator for multi-modal AI and web-based interactions
3. **Learn MCP Basics**: Try the MCP Calculator Service to understand Model Context Protocol fundamentals

## Summary

**Congratulations!** You have successfully:

- **Created multi-modal AI experiences** combining client-side and server-side AI processing
- **Implemented local AI model integration** using modern Java frameworks and SDKs
- **Developed Model Context Protocol services** demonstrating tool integration patterns
