## Prerequisites

Before running this example, make sure you have:

- Completed the [Azure OpenAI setup guide](../../getting-started-azure-openai.md)  
- Deployed an Azure OpenAI resource (via the Azure AI Foundry portal)  
- Deployed the gpt-4o-mini model (or an alternative)  
- An API key and endpoint URL from Azure  

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd 02-SetupDevEnvironment/src/basic-chat-azure

# 2. Configure credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Azure OpenAI credentials

# 3. Run the application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Configuration Options

### Option 1: Environment Variables (.env file) - Recommended

**Step 1: Create your configuration file**  
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Step 2: Add your Azure OpenAI credentials**  
```bash
# Your Azure OpenAI API key (from Azure AI Foundry portal)
AZURE_AI_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here

# Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL (e.g., https://your-hub-name.openai.azure.com/)
AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT=https://your-hub-name.openai.azure.com/
```

> **Security Note**:  
> - Never commit your `.env` file to version control  
> - The `.env` file is already included in `.gitignore`  
> - Keep your API keys secure and rotate them regularly  

### Option 2: GitHub Codespace Secrets

For GitHub Codespaces, set the following secrets in your repository:  
- `AZURE_AI_KEY` - Your Azure OpenAI API key  
- `AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT` - Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL  

The application will automatically detect and use these secrets.

### Alternative: Direct Environment Variables

<details>
<summary>Click to see platform-specific commands</summary>

**Linux/macOS (bash/zsh):**  
```bash
export AZURE_AI_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
export AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT=https://your-hub-name.openai.azure.com/
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**  
```cmd
set AZURE_AI_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
set AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT=https://your-hub-name.openai.azure.com/
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**  
```powershell
$env:AZURE_AI_KEY="your-actual-api-key-here"
$env:AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT="https://your-hub-name.openai.azure.com/"
```
</details>

## Running the Application

### Using Maven

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Using VS Code

1. Open the project in VS Code  
2. Press `F5` or use the "Run and Debug" panel  
3. Select the "Spring Boot-BasicChatApplication" configuration  

> **Note**: The VS Code configuration automatically loads your `.env` file  

### Expected Output

```
Starting Basic Chat with Azure OpenAI...
Environment variables loaded successfully
Connecting to Azure OpenAI...
Sending prompt: What is AI in a short sentence? Max 100 words.

AI Response:
================
AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn like humans.
================

Success! Azure OpenAI connection is working correctly.
```

## Configuration Reference

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `AZURE_AI_KEY` | Azure OpenAI API key | Yes | `abc123...` |
| `AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT` | Azure OpenAI endpoint URL | Yes | `https://my-hub.openai.azure.com/` |
| `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT` | Model deployment name | No | `gpt-4o-mini` (default) |

### Spring Configuration

The `application.yml` file configures:  
- **API Key**: `${AZURE_AI_KEY}` - From the environment variable  
- **Endpoint**: `${AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT}` - From the environment variable  
- **Model**: `${AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT:gpt-4o-mini}` - From the environment variable with a fallback  
- **Temperature**: `0.7` - Controls creativity (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = creative)  
- **Max Tokens**: `500` - Maximum response length  

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<details>
<summary><strong>Error: "The API key is not valid"</strong></summary>

- Check that your `AZURE_AI_KEY` is correctly set in your `.env` file  
- Verify the API key is copied exactly from the Azure AI Foundry portal  
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the key  
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Error: "The endpoint is not valid"</strong></summary>

- Ensure your `AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT` includes the full URL (e.g., `https://your-hub-name.openai.azure.com/`)  
- Check for trailing slash consistency  
- Verify the endpoint matches your Azure deployment region  
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Error: "The deployment was not found"</strong></summary>

- Verify your model deployment name matches exactly what is deployed in Azure  
- Check that the model is successfully deployed and active  
- Try using the default deployment name: `gpt-4o-mini`  
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>VS Code: Environment variables not loading</strong></summary>

- Ensure your `.env` file is in the project root directory (same level as `pom.xml`)  
- Try running `mvn spring-boot:run` in VS Code's integrated terminal  
- Check that the VS Code Java extension is properly installed  
- Verify the launch configuration includes `"envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"`  
</details>

### Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging, uncomment these lines in `application.yml`:  

```yaml
logging:
  level:
    org.springframework.ai: DEBUG
    com.azure: DEBUG
```
